The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis. We used Seurat v2.3.4 to perform standard library size and log-normalization. The mean library size was 3586 transcripts per cell  Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was used to visualize single cell transcriptional profiles and clusters, using the RunUMAP () function in Seurat with default parameters (i.e. n_neighbors = 30L, min_dist = 0.3).",processed matrix generation,EFO:0030023,processed matrix generation,CellRanger v3.0.2;Seurat v2.3.4,alignment||quantification||gene filtering||cell filtering||cell calling,10x 5' library preparation,"The suspension of 10,000 FACS sorted live cells in 1X PBS (calcium and magnesium free) containing 0.04% BSA (A2153, SIGMA) was used as input to the 10X chromium controller system (10x Genomics Inc., product code 120223). The cells were barcoded using the 10x GemCode Technology to separately index each cell’s transcriptome by partitioning them into Gel Bead-in-EMulsions (GEMs). GEMs were generated by combining barcoded Single Cell 50 Gel Beads, RT Master Mix with cells, and Partitioning Oil on a microfluidic chip. The GEM RT reaction was performed in thermocycler (53_x000E_C for 45 min, 85_x000E_C for 5 min, 4_x000E_C hold overnight). Post RT incubation, GEMs were broken, and first strand cDNA was recovered using DynaBeadsR MyOne Silane beads. cDNA amplification was performed with PCR to generate sufficient material to construct both T cell-enriched libraries (TCR) and 50 gene expression libraries. SPRIselect reagent (B23318, Beckman Coulter) was used to perform cleanup post cDNA amplification.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.

The raw count matrix for each of the 29 samples was obtained from the Cell Ranger count filter_matrix output. Briefly, for each sample, Cell Ranger plots the total UMI count against the cell barcode rank in decreasing order of total counts and filters cell barcodes out of the resulting count matrix based on the inflection point of the plot. This step minimizes the number of empty droplets that are included in downstream analyses. We created an initial count matrix combining all 29 samples from all patients. Following count matrix generation, cells with >20% of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes were considered apoptotic and were thus excluded. Following this step, all mitochondrial genes were filtered out of the count matrix. Ribosomal genes and the noncoding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 were excluded due to prior reports of strong influence on downstream clustering. Genes with mean raw count <3.0 were removed from the analysis, resulting in a count matrix of 167283 cells and 16,323 genes for downstream analysis.
